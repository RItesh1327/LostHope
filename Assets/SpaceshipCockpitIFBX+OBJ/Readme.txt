Thank you for buying this model pack.


The textures can be used in a PBR environment (specular and metalness workflow) as well as a non 
PBR environment.

-	Albedo map, PNG format
-	AlbedoAO map, PNG format – this albedo map has the ambient occlusion backed into it
-	Ambient Occlusion (AO) map, PNG format
-	Illumination map, Targa format 32 bit with alpha channel

Depending on your game engine/3D application you may need to rescale the models.

The model is unskinned, unrigged and has no animations. All animations you see in the webplayer preview
are made in the Unity game engine. Almost all 3D applications/game engines have their own built-in 
toolset for keyframe animations. Use this to create e.g. firing animations, etc.
